.env
node_modules

# As, node module is a big file, we've to put this in a gitignore file. So that, it doesn't get uploaded when we push our website into the git repository. 
# After cloning this repository from the git, we should use the command "npm install" to work with the node modules again.

#Again, there are some file which contains sensitive information of the project. Such as .env file. In that file we can hold database url, secret etc.
